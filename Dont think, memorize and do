To become awesome in computer science,
dont try to understand everything from the ground up

you dont need the fundamentals all the time to do puny work that can be done simply using the superficials

learn javascript
learn how to make the websites, you dont need any why in it
understand the basic elements needed in a good website and how to make it using javascript
memorize the process of hosting a website 
the server concepts
how to build the back end 
how to connect with a database

you know the technologies now, you need to know the stack but you cannot learn the real power or use of stack from the fundamentals, you need to learn it using practical uses and problem solving in real life.

learn the python stacks
learn the javascipt stacks
you know linux, learn bash and bash scripting
dont think of why something works, think of how something works!!!!!
question how to make a website, not why a website works using something and not other things, these questions are for way later in your journey of computer scinece engineering and maturity

ask how to write python in a way that solves some problem that you are facing or that others are facing
ask how to write Linux OS scripts using python
ask how to contribute to linux kernel development using cpp or rust
ask how to write to problem solve, not finding why a language works before having any fucking use of it for yourself.

how to solve different kind of data structure and algorithm problems in python?
how to program different kind of projects usinig python?

just see a problem or code_art or project and ask yourself how to write that exact thing for yourself
YOU CAN ONLY CREATE NOVELTY THROUGH REPETITIONS
YOU CAN ONLY LEARN THROUGH COPYING GREAT ARTISTS

COPY THE CODES WORD BY WORD THAT YOU LIKE, THAT YOU LOVE!!!!
COPY HELLISHLY AND LEARN FROM THEM, DO NOT TRY TO WRITE NEW CODE, TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND MEMORIZE AND LEARN GREAT CODES OF PYTHON WRITTEN BY OTHERS FIRST, WRITTEN BY GREAT PYTHONISTAS
LEARN HOW YOUTUBE IS CODED 
LEARN HOW LINUX IS CODED

TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN TWITTER
TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN FACEBOOK
TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN AMAZON
TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN YOUTUBE
TRY TO MAKE YOUR OWN GREATEST COPY
YOUR FIRST ORIGINAL IDEA WILL TAKE TIME TO COME AND FLOURISH!!!!

I want to learn python, meaning copy great coders, learn how to write games in python, i just want to memorize and copy anybody that i see writing great python codes, if you cannot do every project done by tech with tim on python by yourself, just memorize and try to recreate it for yourself from the github repo that he has shared with public!!
