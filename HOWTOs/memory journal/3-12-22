i memorized that i can do anything that i set my mind to
i want to become the best computer scientist in the world, however long it takes.

i want to rank in dsa, mle

i want to excel in dsa, foss, mle, hacking, sharing

i want to become an excellent programmer

i dont care if i joined the party early or late, i want to become very good by the end of this year meaning 2022, i have about  27 days left to achieve this. i will master dsa, no matter what, i will master foss, i will master hacking, i will master sharing with others in different mediums like youtube, blogs, chats and things

i will give everything to learn every nook and crany of computer science basics, i will not give up, i will become just as good as those  of iit fucking engineers from bombay or kharagpur

i will get mlh, gsoc, gsod, outreachy, linux foundation and other stuffs right.

i have all the  time in the world, only thing necessary is to clear every fucking concept in computer science and go forward in life in every possible dimension and help the people who are in them
