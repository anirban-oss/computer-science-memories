I do not think memorised something related to python or work

I remembered 
1. PAN - Permanent Account Number
2. TIN - Taxpayer Identification Number
3. SWIFT - Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications
4. BIC - Bank Identifier Code

5. SWIFT and BIC are similar in meaning and sometimes used inter-changeably.
6. The BIC/SWIFT code identifies your country, city, bank, and branch: As we have seen, all SWIFT/BIC codes consist of 8-11 characters, depending on the country and bank in which you hold an account. These are typically arranged in the following format: 4 digit bank code - 2 digit country code - 2 digit location code - 3 digit branch code (optional).

I remembered my own PAN. BANK NUMBER. IFSC. SWIFT.
