I memorized today that I should not worry about everything at the same time, worry about one thing only until its complete, only then move on to the next worry

start with the basics again, you have got nothing to lose but your chains

manage the pain of learning things slowly, do not ever manage the time of learning things slowly which is inevitable

learn slowly
learn daily
learn happily

take rest from the evening, no matter what, study a lot in the morning to evening but evening is for fun and calmness
whatever can happen, will happen.

You take on small comfortably challenging stuff everyday, 

work is the 80% stuff that you will do in your life, choose wisely and even more so, fall in love rahter than your wife or your girlfriend

fall in love with computers, try to learn all about it, in all the dimensions of it, try to code stuff into existence, get a rank in dsa, get a rank in foss, get a rank in mle, get a rank in hacking

you do love computers from the very childhood, this is your chance, you have been waiting to learn computers intimately for your entire life, make it a mission to learn useful things and get a job in it too.

learn what to do from the mentor and keep doing it until you become a master in it

you have only one thing going for you, your indomitable spirit.
If the mentor tells you to master something, you go and do that until you have achieved mastery over it.
