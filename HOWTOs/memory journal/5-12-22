i memorized the car number plate and bike number plate yesterday
CAR  = WB36G1105
BIKE = WB36B7703

there is a cool pattern in them 1105 has a difference of 4 in them, this is true for 7703 too, B and G too has difference of 4 as C,D,E,F.
these things are super cool
also the wb36 commonality is good too

memorization is the greatest gift of humanity
this is the only reason for the allowance of all the progress in our society and lifetime.
we teach others what we have learnt from our failures
we learn from failures of others too

we try stuff, fail at it, then correct it and repeat that until we fail again and need better methods.

i try dsa, fail at solving dsa, i correct myself on how to solve that problem in dsa and then try again, i continue this  until i have all the bruises of learning data structures and algorithms to make a real difference in the world.
