i memorized what is important in life, no matter what degree and what shit you have in life

clear the basics or nothing can float your boat
basics are easy, basics are a must, basics take time, do basics as much as possible, start from the scratch or basics as much as possible, you will become unstoppable if you can learn basics under pressure.

you need a better routine now, you are more resilient now, you have more money now, you are more powerful now, you can binge watch courses  more now! you are being more and more awesome each day!
