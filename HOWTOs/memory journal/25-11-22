I memorized the golden teaching of Barabara Oakley on cognitive distortion that sometimes we think too much of something when its nothing in reality

i do mistakes, only mistake that i can do after that is by not recognizing that i did a fucking mistake before because then my foundation will be weak forever

i will learn math if i need to do good ml
i will learn coding if i need to do good ml
i will learn all that is necessary with enought that i need to become good at ml and ai and dl.

I memorized to make opportunities for myself
I memorized that i have fuckinig compulsive and impulsive problems that need to be noted so that i do not make them in the future
I memorize to forgive myself after i make mistakes and focus on the next thing and to say sorry to somebody if my mistake has harmed them

i cannot go back in time and make it alright but i can make it work in the present and help them if i can after my fuck up!

from tomorrow write build, memory and practice starting with those kid statements like I built ..., I practiced ..., I memorized .... and for daily diary, you can i felt or i did or i believe and things like that, its a bit free than the rest of journals.
