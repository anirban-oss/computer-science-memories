A start up is all about creating values and then delivering on them with efficency and consistency over time.

You can generate value only if the user is dependent or falls in love with the product or service that you are generating for them in any way or form.

To generate value, you need to be efficient with the use of resources and then the distribution of the service/product.

You need to 'take less from the user and give more' and perhaps time is the least thing you can take from someone and that too is dependent on how fast you can teach them about your product and let them use it.

TAKE LESS AND GIVE BACK MORE
THIS CREATES VALUE OF THE PRODUCT/HUMAN BEING
THIS CREATES LOVE AND RESPECT FOR SOMEONE

YOU HAVE AN AWESOME GIFT OF BEING HAPPY WITH VERY LESS OF SOMETHING, USE THIS TO BUILD GREAT BUSINESSES, YOU CAN BE HAPPY WITH EVEN MARGINAL PROFITS AFTER DOING BUSINESS WITH SOMEONE, ALL YOU CARE ABOUT IS THE LOVE AND THE HELP.

WHEN YOU GO FOR A BIKE RIDE, DO NOT GIVE YOURSELF MORE IF YOU CAN BE CONTENT WITH LESS AND RETURN TO WORK

WORK MORE, GIVE MORE, TAKE LESS, GIVE BACK MORE!
