I built replit day 45 today and shared it on twitter and linkedin
People are finally in my linkedin profile

I love that I get to study machine learning everyday and I want to make the most of this opportunity
If books are there to get machine learning expertise to beginner level and get a job, I will hunt it, read it, internalise it and enjoy it for life.
