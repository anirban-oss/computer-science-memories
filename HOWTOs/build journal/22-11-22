The Star War Names Generator
I used a function to reduce the coloring of text in future cases, I automated out of necessity for the first time.

I shared my progress in twitter and linkedin profile

I sent detail to get hired as an intern in hosteldevta company

I learned how to make a link for my resume only through google drive docs and sent it to hosteldevta
I also saw how to do the same in microsoft word online and offline but did not use it.
