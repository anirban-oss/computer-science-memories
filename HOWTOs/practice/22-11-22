I have not practiced anything old learning today yet knowingly.

I used python to complete replit 100 days code

I can practice DSA by simply writing out the code of neetcode.io blind 75 solutions and also try to learn it on youtube and various platforms.

I saw the github stash, fetch, pull, etc diagram on twitter which I always want to memorize by heart and draw it on my copy but never did. I can do that now and finish git structures.

I learnt markdown a few days back, I can do practice and revision of that knowledge again today to make it stick to memory and use it as per need be.

My list of practice can be:
	markdown
	github
	git
	python syntax
	python builtin commands
	python most used libraries use
	python basic projecs
	dsa old problems
	foss appwrite contribution.md reading
	kaggle ml certificates
	kaggle easy competitions
