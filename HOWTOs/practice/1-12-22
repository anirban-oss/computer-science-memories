I practiced python certainly

I did a lot of things today, but I feel stressed due to kaggleX weirdities

I work the best when I am alone and stress free
I dont want too many accolades, I just want money for livelihood and live a normal life
I want to go to San Francisco once

I want to live upto my potential
I want to help people 
I want to do good business

I want to be with kind people and behave kindly to others even those that may not be kind to me
I want to have good relationships with others 

I practiced the thought of doing only one thing each day
and not to think of too many things while programming

First you  have to break down the problem and then you have to solve them one by one, the problems are not super difficult but they require attention to give the best effect

I will try to study DSA again tomorrow
I feel like I should make a educational nutrition list like I used to make for food

food - protein, fruits, vegetables, dairy, grain, sunlight, air, water
# emotion - happiness, determination, retrying things, not giving up, gritty

or study = dsa, foss, mle, hacking, ui/ux
