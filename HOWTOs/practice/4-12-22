i have not been able to practice focusedly for a long time now
i am ready to learn whatever comes in my way

i need my mentor to tell me what i need to practice and master to be able to code in machine learning algorithms very well

i am not afraid of maths or ml, i am not afraid of python or cpp

i will practice a lot in the  coming months and secure myself a great job

i will work very hard and become a good devleoper in the future

i will use my philosphical skills to build awesome stuff and help make the world a better place to live in
