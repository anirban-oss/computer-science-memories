i practice cognitive distortion today to prevent myself from thinking that i am an imposter or a failure and that i cannot do anything worthwhile in computer science and data science or engineering

I will make it a mission to build myself better each day.
I will problem solve like i did today so that i dont undo all that i have done and worked hard to achieve

i will make the most use of kaggleX mentorship
i will learn how far am i in the race to become good in kaggle
i will learn all the thinking that is necessary to become good in computer science, data science, machine learning, deep learning and everything related to these

i will get a job at google SF one day, maybe even after kagglex i will apply there.
