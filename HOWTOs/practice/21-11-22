I did not journal what i did on 
	20-11-22

I have to make a habit of writing what i am doing everyday or its very easy to miss things that i have worked on and spend more time than necessary on it.

I did replit today
I did git and github computer science memories repo journal update today
I did monkeytype
I did twitter/linkedin
I did youtube a little with two sum problem
I did deepstash and currently working to make a two sum stash on it

I dont think i will make youtube videos today
I dont think i will do coursera or freecodecamp today as my plate is quite full as it is

I intend to change the directory names that i am currently using to build, memorize and practice journalling on, give them something succinct to look and type in for.
