“The design thinking process in a nutshell is really deeply understanding people and their needs, synthesizing down what problems you’re going to solve, ideating around what concepts to design, and then prototyping and testing over and over again while getting real user feedback,” says Dryer.

Design thinking is a type of creative problem solving. 
“It’s a way of thinking and making that keeps the user at the center of everything,” explains experience designer Meg Dryer. 

“It’s a human-centered approach to developing products, services, and experiences.” 

	1. Empathize: Study the values of your users.

		Engage: Interview and interact with users.
		Immerse: Put yourself in their shoes.

	2. Define: Name the problem that you’ll solve.

	3. Ideate: Come up with creative solutions.

	4. Prototype: Fail fast to learn fast.

	5. Test: Go back to the drawing board.
