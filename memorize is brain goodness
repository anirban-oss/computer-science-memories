DO NOT THINK, MEMORIZE
BRAIN CAN ONLY MEMORIZE, JUST AS HEART CAN ONLY PUMP, LEGS CAN ONLY WALK AND SO ON.

WHEN YOU ARE LEARNING SOMETHING NEXT TIME, IDENTIFY THE PARTS TO MEMORIZE FIRST AND THEN MEMORIZE THEM PERFECTLY, AND THEN TRY TO PRACTICE USING EASY OR SOLVED EXAMPLES AND THEN GO ON TO UNKNOWN TERRITORIES, ONLY THEN YOU SHOULD TRY TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

DO NOT UNDERSTAND SOMETHING, BEFORE DOING IT IN REAL LIFE.
NEVER EVER TRY TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BEFORE DOING IT AND USING IT.
OVERWHELMINGLY, THEORY FOLLOWS PRACTICE.

*MEMORIZE* A SUBJECT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET THE LAY OF THE LAND, WHAT ARE ALL THE ITEMS IN A SUBJECT, THE COGNITION OF IT, ITS LIKE LEARNING THE NAME OF A PERSON BEFORE KNOWING EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT SOMEONE.

*UNDERSTAND* A SUBJECT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO GET THE CONNECTIONS WITHIN THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE SUBJECT, WHAT IS IT USED FOR, HOW, WHY, WHEN, WHERE, WHICH, WHO.

*PRACTICE* TO SEE IF YOU REALLY UNDERSTAND THE SUBJECT AND IF THERE IS SOMETHING UNTOLD OR UNWRITTEN OF HIDDEN ASPECT OF THE SUBJECT TO BE LEARNT, WHICH IS ONLY VISIBLE BY DOING IT.

*REPETITIONS* OF THE PRACTICE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE YOU WILL FORGET WHAT YOU MEMORIZED, UNDERSTOOD, PRACTICED WITH TIME IF YOU DO NOT DO IT EVERYDAY OR IN SOME FORM OF CONTINUUM OF ITS USE. AND ALL YOUR EFFORTS WOULD GO IN VAIN.

After the difficult process of understanding something, memorization of it is the most important thing. Understanding what you are memorizing helps to memorize it easily, it is a shortcut to memorization but **MEMORIZATION** is still the real deal of education, a man without memory is more difficult than a man without understanding.

how to conquer any subject in life?
  first, memroize all the necessary jargons
  secondly, understand the way different parts of the subject relate and connect with each other and how they behave
  thirdly, practice your memorizations and understanding  together to solve 'solved examples' or simple examples to get a hang of what you just learnt.
  fourth, repeat the practice of this new tool that you learnt in various problems of your life, and learn how others have used it before you to solve similar problems that they faced 
  fifth, now relax and reflect and enjoy what you just achieved.
  
memorization of a topic alone does not mean that you have conquered the subject
similarly, understanding a topic alone does not mean that you have conquered the subject
with practice only, you have not conquered the subject
with repetition only, you have not conquered the subject

only when all the heavenly four combine in yourself and your brain, you have achieved something that is awesome and worth all the work you did.
