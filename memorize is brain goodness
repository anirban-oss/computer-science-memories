how to conquer any subject in life?
  first, memroize all the necessary jargons
  secondly, understand the way different parts of the subject relate and connect with each other and how they behave
  thirdly, practice your memorizations and understanding  together to solve 'solved examples' or simple examples to get a hang of what you just learnt.
  fourth, repeat the practice of this new tool that you learnt in various problems of your life, and learn how others have used it before you to solve similar problems that they faced 
  fifth, now relax and reflect and enjoy what you just achieved.
  
memorization of a topic alone does not mean that you have conquered the subject
similarly, understanding a topic alone does not mean that you have conquered the subject
with practice only, you have not conquered the subject
with repetition only, you have not conquered the subject

only when all the heavenly four combine in yourself and your brain, you have achieved something that is awesome and worth all the work you did.
