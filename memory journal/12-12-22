how do you help someone?
	by building things that are useful to them and us by iteration and customization

	how do you build something?
		by doing guess work at what one wants 
		by doing guess work at how to make something for that want
		then practicing what you find useful to do

			if you find it useful, memorize it.
				how to memorize?
					practice it 5 times or
					repeat it 5 times or 
					do it 5 times

so the way things are gonna work for you is:
build - problem solve - useful - memorize - practice - refine

practice makes a man perfect as he does the same activity enough times to find the problems within it and how to address them.
