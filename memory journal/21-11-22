i actually dont remember what i did the days before this day, because i did not keep a track of what i did

19-11-22,20-11-22, i know i worked but i dont know on what and why and how and where clearly

i did not even revise anything

memory can only happen by revision and first hand practice of new material when new material is presented.

i want to master the art of remembering useful things
i need to maintain a memory journal of all the things that are useful to me and i should remember in particular

i also need to maintain practice, repetiton, understanding journal to become a world class brain athlete in computer science for now until i get a big job or any domain that i want to get involved in future

more you document your work, more you have control and freedom over it and this allows you to experiment very efficiently and creatively in future.
