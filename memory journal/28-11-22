i remembered that you will always be finite no matter how much you think differently or cleverly

you have only one chance to have a happy life
if you find happiness in computer scince, live every second in it

there is a lot of time, just dont waste a second of it thinking that you dont have time to do something, its the biggest lie in the universe

you make time for the things that are important to you

learn happily
learn slowly
learn daily

you are in control 
master yourself!

there is enough opportunity in the world to make something of yourself and realise your dreams, you just have to keep working towards it, there are no dreams that human beings can imagine and not achieve it, only efforts are necessary towards it.
