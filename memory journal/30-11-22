memorization seems to be the weakest area of mine

i dont seem to try to memorize what i find useful throughout the day, i forget it and dont care and waste time again next time when the same problem occurs to me 

like i forgot ls -lv is the way to sort files numerically, and with ls, only alphabetically things are done listed

i want to master memorization, i want to note things that are useful in a day, i want to journal it throughout the day and make use of it next time when i see it

the thing is, what you have memorized and use all the time, you take it so much for granted that you dont do more of it in the present, after you reach your mediocrity, i will not be that guy, i will memorize useful things throughout my life!!!!

i will make memorization my biggest talent of them all
