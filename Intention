November 5th 2022
Code like your life depens on it
You did good today, you fixed the pipeline system of your whole house
You learnt how awesome your father is, how his dedication to his job has proved his testimony and how you crave such a glowing respect for self

I commit here today that I intend to do awesome projects in this week and the next, before the next coding helpline 101 where I can show David a body of work that I have done within this timeframe and be awesome!
I intend to make a website with django framework and one with flask.
I intend to deploy a artificial intelligence work too.
I intend to do automations on my linux or some virtual machines.
I want to be comfortable writing scripts using python and do automation of repetitive tasks that surround me.

I have studied this field long enough to know that I can make my work, only some patience, hard work and a portfolio is needed to showcase my drive.

I will mark each day from today with awesome projects in it and make that a reality.

I will make my four pull requests for the hacktoberfest whether I win a tshirt or not.
I want to study mindsDB github repo, so that I know how to contribute and try to participate in that too.

I will make sure from today that I do every task each day to become more than a nobody as I breathe each day.
