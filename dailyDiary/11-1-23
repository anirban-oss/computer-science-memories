i love computer science more everyday!
i hope to get outreachy fellowship, at least try to get it!

i will work more hard on python basics, data structures and algorithms and object oriented programming, then machine learning!!!

i have got all the resources, only thing that is needed now is going through each of them one at a time, being patient and extremely gritty when i fail to solve a problem in the domain

i want to work at google and openAI and i will make it work no matter what, i will not let my knowledge of philosophy and computer science go to waste!

i plan  to build a better mentor relationship with kriti no matter what and try to get a job offer from her atleast

i want to work a lot and help many people!

i need to work on my perfect schedule everyday so that i can be awesome and wonderful in future!

i will read the deep learning book by ian goodfellow
