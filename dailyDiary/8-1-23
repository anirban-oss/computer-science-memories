i love computer science engineering!
i want to devote myself completely to the cause of CSE
i want all the pain in it
i want all the pleasures for everybody else
i want nothing else but the mastery over this subject that i am studying

i want to become a good machine learning engineer in the industry
i dont know much about it but i want to give all my time and practice and trials to learn it very well to my abilities
i will not give up no matter how many times i fail
this is my calling
i love this education!
