i am failing to complete more tasks everyday than replit and hackerrank, it feels hard for me

i want to do NLP but i also want to continue my streaks on the previous seven streaks that i was already doing

i have joined replit testing by soren

i am doing kaggleX

how to schedule or do work so that i can balance doing all of them in some way

i want the basics of data science, i should do that as fast as possible and then continue my streaks again, there is not much in the basics!
i can do it, i just need to give time and be better at processing the studies
