I made a replit todo list project today with success and  happiness.

I am going to do some DSA very well too.
I will look at some github project that i can contribute for real and get a job.
I will read a page in some book.

A reader is made by his reading habit
A coder is made by his coding habit

A kind person is made by his habit of being kind
A helpful person is made by his habit of being helpful
A wealthy person is made by his habit of accumulating wealth.

An active person is made by his habit of exercise everyday

An healthy person is made by his habit of eating healthy everyday

A man with a good SLEEP is made by his habit of being able to relax knowing things may or may not go in his way everyday. A person who can meditate on nothingness, A person who  can be happy anyways always.
