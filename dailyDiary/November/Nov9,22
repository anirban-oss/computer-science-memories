* I missed Nov8, I did not update anything yesterday, sorry!

Today I learned computational thinking again
and the various elements in it

	what is a problem?
	what is translation of solution from one domain to another?

	the famous steps:
		Decomposition of problems or concepts into simple parts that are doable by myself and comfortable with, 
		if not, then try to get to that level of fluency!
		Abstraction 
		Pattern Recognition
		Algorithmic Design
		Debugging and evaluation

Break down any problem that you face into these elements and try to see where you are, and what can you do to deal with them?
