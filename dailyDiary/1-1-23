this new year i resolute to doing one thing per year and see how far i go with it, how far it takes me along
and the subject for this year would be AI.

the idea for this year is not to be afraid, not to be fidgety, not to be anxious of time while doing what i aim to do or learn in AI

Its not that hard, its easy, give all of yourself, see where it goes after that.

Be brave, be steady, be patient.
