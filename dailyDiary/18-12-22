i got the hp all in one pc but could not use it
the product had mouse missing, the keyboard looked old, monitor bezel was coming out, this wasted my time but gave me experience to never buy things that are not first person 

i hope the money comes through so that  i can do other  things with it

just be calm, whenever in trouble, take deep breaths, do what is right, do what is logical, do not blame what is not in your control.

you forked youtube in the console, use that to learn about project|portfolio.
