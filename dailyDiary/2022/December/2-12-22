Yeah doing it at 11:40 PM but still counts
watched 'The Action Hero' by Ayushman Khurrana, it cleared my mind

How do i want to go forward in CS with all of these subjects and studies to do all the time everywhere and all at once.
I want to become one of the best computer scientist in the world, not right nowm not this year, but as long as I live, I will try, I want to try everyday to become that, one of the best.

I will treat cracking DSA exams like olympiad exams but the ones that come with good pay
I will treat the MLE projects as science experiments and make it a passion of mine to learn and enhance them as much as I can before getting a job and even after getting one still

EGO IS THE ENEMY, I WANTED TO PAINT THAT ON THE WALL AFTER COMING FROM THE FILM, BUT IT WAS LATE, AND TOOK TIME TO EAT, SETTLE DOWN TO SLEEP AND REMEMBER I HAVE NOT DONE THE GIT THING AND NOW DOING IT OF COURSE

BUT THE MAIN THING IS THAT, I DID NOT WRITE IT DOWN AS A TASK, AND I DID NOT REMEMBER DOING IT FOR ONCE AFTER ENTERING THE HOUSE.

I NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE TASKS I AM PRIORITIZING FOR MYSELF AND DOING IT VERY WELL TO SET A BENCHMARK FOR QUALITY CONTROL IN THE FUTURE.

START SMALL, START EASY.
DO DAILY, BUT DONT DO LESS, DONT BURNOUT

YOU HAVE TIME, YOU'RE JUST 26, JUST STUDY WITH LOVE, MEMORISE, PRACTICE. BECOME MASTER IN YOUR DOMAIN AREA

YOU HAVE ONLY ONE TASK AT HAND, 'MON DIYE PORA-SONA KORA' AND NOTHING ELSE.
CLEARING FUNDAMENTALS AND NOTHING ELSE.

START WITH THE BASICS AGAIN IF THE FOUNDATION IS WEAK, WHICH IT IS. COMPLETE COMPUTATIONAL THINKING COURSE IN COURSERA BY THIS WEEKEND. TAKE TARGETS AND FINISH THEM.
