i am failing to complete more tasks everyday than replit and hackerrank, it feels hard for me

i want to do NLP but i also want to continue my streaks on the previous seven streaks that i was already doing

i have joined replit testing by soren

i am doing kaggleX

how to schedule or do work so that i can balance doing all of them in some way

i want the basics of data science, i should do that as fast as possible and then continue my streaks again, there is not much in the basics!
i can do it, i just need to give time and be better at processing the studies

i am not having enough time to do the scheduling
i am not having enough time to do the journaling
i want more from myself

i must  lose something for that to happen
lets leave hacking and foss right  now
lets continue with MLE first and then do DSA and projects if time permits

yes this feels more secure, lets do the thing that is paying you first thing in the morning, so you feel less guilty of it
after that do python dsa and projects
