i built the replit recursion challenge
i still dont understand it very well 
but because of practice i was able to do it in a few try.

i did the kagglex communication and thinking

i completed the streaks - deepstash, replit, monkeytype, twitter, linkedin, and now github

i want to become one of the best machine learning engineer
i want to do very good in math at fundamental level

i want to be able to do data structures and algorithm questions very well

i want to be able to implement and understand the machine learning algorithms that are being used, to customize them for myself

i want to master problem solving by computational thinking.

i have added hackerrank 30 days of code to my list! i did the day 0 yesterday, i am also writing about one tweet about my progress and journey on twitter for about 17 days now.
