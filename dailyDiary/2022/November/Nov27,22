I am sorry i forgot to journal yesterday, did other things on github and got the streak and forgot about journalling somehow because I felt stressed from winning 1000$ google money to study MLE
and i dont think i am good enough for the effort
i have challenged myself to do 100 ml projects in the four months period

i want to be able to get a good job after completing the kaggleX bipoc mentorship program.

i understood that ego is the enemy
i repeat myself often nowadays but stil my basics are not covered
