mirror got broke to thousand pieces. because of meta stable position or local minima in gradient descent.
one can do a lot of fun while living through meta-stability but is destroyed with the first touch of pure stability problem, which if you are poor especially, its bound to happen.

you are in a position in your life where its meta stable. you need food, clothes and shelter to be alive, you have none of your own, you need money, what do you have? time to study. 

studied leet code "two sum" problem again.

concretizing on my future journey of what to do, whether to pursue computer science all in or to do a meta stable job to sustain myself now while also learning computer science.
