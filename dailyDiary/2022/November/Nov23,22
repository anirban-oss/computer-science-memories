I am thinking of making another repo named computer science adventures dealing with all the cool stuff that we can do or atleast that i have done until now just within the laptop itself.

i have had the conversation with the guy 'Sairam', he gave me pretty good advice to focus on what i am doing to take it to another level, not stretching oneself too thin, i liked him

i dont know if i can make it in this world of computer science and coding
it seems very tough on people like me who are from nowhere but atleast they are giving me a chance or an opportunity to prove myself in public with as many failures i can do to a final success.

i am loving everyday 
i promise to learn python like nobody has ever learnt it before
i will give 10000% of myself to the goal of making myself one of the greatest members of the planet earth, just look at elon musk, yeah fuck yeah!

i am not giving up, i dont have any reason to!
i can learn coding and make my dream come true of becoming one of the greatest individuals on this planet

i will learn dsa no matter what 
i will learn data science and ml no matter what
i will stay healthy no matter how much pressure is on me
i will become good in india inspite of the environment that i am put in

i love myself, more than god, more than my neighbors
i belive only in myself
i promise to make my dreams come true if nobody else will

i love this fate
i love this life
i love this moment 
i love being me
i am a coder
i am a thinker
i am a writer
i am a tinkerer

i am crazy
i am dreamy
i engineer
i socialise

i get insecure
i overcome obstacles
i get up
i dont give up
i am a figher

i will fight my way forward in this life!
