i like today.
i feel like i have got the ultimate kernel for cracking dsa and foss,
its simple, its just consistent trial and error to make a career in computer science. 
 
i am going to do atleast one dsa everyday!
	participate in competitions
	teach others about dsa
i am going to post on twitter one thread about what i built today.
	something i memorized that is useful
	something i understood
	something i read from others
i am going to commit on github everyday.
	help somebody with their project.





i learned a little bit about typescript  today.
