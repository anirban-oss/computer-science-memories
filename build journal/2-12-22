i built replit day 46 today

i plan to build the art of 'EGO IS THE ENEMY' tomorrow on one of my room walls.

i built my mentality for cracking dsa and mle in the coming months

i built my talk about needs to the mentor responsible for me in kaggleX
i will speak honestly about where i am in the journey to master MLE

i will say i am not even very good at coding and i want to be good at it before i become good at mle

i want to build an awesome portfolio in the coming months
