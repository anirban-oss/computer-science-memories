i build projects or algorithms or things
	so that i learn different ways of problem solving
		and i recognize the useful things in it for my life or for others 
			and then i memorize them instantly

			there cannot be any gap between building, then problem solving, then finding what method was useful and then finally memorizing it and becoming very fluent in that technique.

if you learn too much, you dont memorize anything, better is learn less but make learn useful by memorizing it.

mark your hunt each day on what you would like to memorize and not just read through and through.

what you memorize in a day is the distillation of building something cool, problem solving for practical purposes, finding what is really useful to you in the field.

memorization is the most important thing.
