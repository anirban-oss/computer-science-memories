i built hangman game without the ascii art
i am proud of myself for being able to do that and push myself

i will build my career in data science and live a healthy life

i will build tools to help me against my compulsive behaviors and impulsive actions.

i will make it a mission in my life to not give up on myself and learn as much as possible as long as possible, help as many people as possible, i will not give up on life

i am a fighter
i am a warrior
i will build my name in this life
i will not give up on myself, no matter what

i will do good with the time that i have left on this earth
i will help people, i will ask for help when i am in trouble

i will go to google san francisco one day
i will make the most out of kagglex bipoc mentorship
i will learn a lot, i will learn about computational thinking
i will learn about stochastic thinking, algorithmic thinking, problem solving, building stuff, engineering stuff
