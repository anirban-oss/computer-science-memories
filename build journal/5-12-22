i built  replit day 49
i plan to build the rest 51 in the next 5 days, i guess i can work out 10 more today, which leaves 40 for tomorrow and if i can continue this pace, there will be none left at the end and i can be happy that i know something that is useful in python.

i want to dedicate my life to python
i want to learn it all and make some money to live an independent life
