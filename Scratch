# i write anything that i want here and organize for the right file later
i am learning more and more from the same lecture of Prof Eric Grimson on intro to CS and programming

i love the fact that programming and computation is just a recipe and literally nothing else than that.

Python is just a language just like anything else in this world
You can only do stuff like communication with a language nothing else
What you can do with python, you can do with english and you can do with maths
Its just that these things help at different things more than the other.

And the fact that our brain can fall into infinite loops even in the easiest of challenges if the test is set in such a way.
The only way you get out of it like Ctrl+C is only through the people around you or some physical limitation that crashes you from doing it

The best we can do is try to do as we see things getting done and hope for the best
Luck is a very important thing and it has no morality, you get anything.
