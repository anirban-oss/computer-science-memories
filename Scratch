# i write anything that i want here and organize for the right file later
i am learning more and more from the same lecture of Prof Eric Grimson on intro to CS and programming

i love the fact that programming and computation is just a recipe and literally nothing else than that.

Python is just a language just like anything else in this world
You can only do stuff like communication with a language nothing else
What you can do with python, you can do with english and you can do with maths
Its just that these things help at different things more than the other.

And the fact that our brain can fall into infinite loops even in the easiest of challenges if the test is set in such a way.
The only way you get out of it like Ctrl+C is only through the people around you or some physical limitation that crashes you from doing it

The best we can do is try to do as we see things getting done and hope for the best
Luck is a very important thing and it has no morality, you get anything.

tried learning maths and other things for no reason all of a sudden from the heron of alexandria square root trigger and from that to exponentiation and finally to exponential function graph, why does negative integers, zero and one is not considered in that range
how to math, tried translating exponentiation in terms of addition and failed in some ways and won too, i will try that again tomorrow sometime
i failed to study intro to cs only, i failed to study how to speak too.
i plan to organize myself tomorrow and study intro to CS in better way.
memorization copy, practice copy, repetitions copy, teaching copy and neither official understanding copy has been made yet after years of trying.
what is your plan tomorrow?
  study intro to cs
  check the streak of deepstash and github
  post something on twitter, a tweet thread or something like that
  prepare something for youtube based on your day
  get open source prep too
  try out replit 100 days of code again
  practice coding somewhere like hackerrank, etc
