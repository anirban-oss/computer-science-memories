As I age in life, I understand what is really important in life?
	I am alive and I am breathing
	I am healthy as I exercise and eat healthy daily
	My character is built by repetition of good deeds, because the good deeds are mine and not others. Others may be helped by them but I do it, I got the opportunity to do that, this is wonderful!
	I sleep with other people as pillars in my life like my father, mother, sister, some friends and myself
	
	My duty everyday is to talk to people nicely and 
	help people around me to get their job done or make their life a little easier with me than without me.

SO THE FINAL THING IS THIS, 
	HELP YOURSELF EARN MONEY
	HELP YOUR PARENTS BE PROUD OF YOU
	HELP YOUR FRIENDS BE PROUD OF YOU
	HELP YOUR TEACHERS BE PROUD OF YOU
	HELP YOUR ENVIRONMENT BE PROUD OF YOU
	
Final tally: your breath is your greatest luxury, never shy away from work that will help yourself or your family
never lose patience on getting mastery over something or on doing some good work for somebody or for yourself

No tally with just words: breath, family, friends, money, kindness

the world wants to be more productive as well as more humane as it progresses to the future and experince itself.

the important things in this life are very few, dont get deluded with other things in the way

when you open your laptop, only one thing is important to you, its the knowledge of how the damn thing works and nothing else, learn about laptop, learn about coding, learn about computer science, just keep learning and practicing and giving your best to memorize and practice coding everyday, its not that hard and you can get a mediocre job, you are good enough for that!

you are a good person,
you are hard working
you are patient
you are diligent
you are awesome
you are kind
you are lovable
just do what is right, the rest doesnt matter

you cannot force good opportunities to come at you, you can only do what is right and the rest will happen when it should

you are good enough to learn computer science head to toe
you are good enough to become a great businessman
you are good enough to be kind to those who are cruel to you
you have achieved mastery over yourself, meaning you can control your sleep, nutrition, exercise, relationships, business
you know what is mental health, what are the good and the bad in it.
