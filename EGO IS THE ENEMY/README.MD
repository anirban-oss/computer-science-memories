Daily ego check writing:

Aspiring: (equal method)
	write about your desires today.
	if you wanted to be equal to somebody you admire or you wanted it all for yourself only, singular greatness
	always aspire to be equal and helpful to others

Succeeding: (plus method)
	write about your successes today.
	did you achieve it all by yourself?
	or you had taken help from everybody else and then got the opportunity to work and have success at the stuff that you were doing?
	always share your successes with people around you who have helped you in giving you the environment to achieve it
	we stand on the shoulders of the giants

Failing: (minus method)
	write about your failures today.
	did you fail because of somebody else?
	never blame everybody else for your own mistakes or bad luck
	all the burden is not on you, but you had a part there, and nature had her too, its okay, things happen.
	the next best thing is to share your failure with others and the coming generation, so that they do not make the same mistake.
