i aspire to be equal to others
i will tame my ego from asking to be better than anybody else
this is a insecure move, be real, be good, be happy, help others reach your  level and do not believe anybody who says you cannot be as good as them

if a job has been done by a human before, it can be done by you too!!!

dont give up, push yourself to be equal to the best and help others become their best self or whatever they want in this journey of life
