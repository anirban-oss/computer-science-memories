i aspired to be openAI residency even without being a simple data scientist in India, shame on me, My ego is so inflated that it cannot even see the reality that is unfolding infront of me

i will apologize to Kriti and do a sql certificate and get the job application done, whatever happnes happens!

i aspired to be better than everybody else
this is wrong, this was my ego speaking, i must learn from today's incident and try to avoid this in future when somebody tries to be helpful to me.

i aspire to be equal to others not better
i aspire to help people be equal to me or better not less
i aspire to be the best and make others as good as me too
