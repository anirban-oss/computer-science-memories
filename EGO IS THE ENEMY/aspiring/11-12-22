i aspire to be a good ai ethicist and help companies do more of their work.

i aspire to be equal and not better
i aspire to make equal and not worse

i do not aspire to boost my ego but tame it and i am willing to do this practice everyday as long as needed and possible, this soothes me, thank you god for showing me this way!
