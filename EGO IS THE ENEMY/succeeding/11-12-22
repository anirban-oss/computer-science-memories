i succeeded in writing about 
	what did you build and problem solve?
		i did replit debugger challenge and learnt how to learn about code by slowing it down and going one step at a time
		i must do the same for myself too
		you want to learn something very well, you have got to give up a lot of your self and only then hope, not demand, may you get it

	what did you find useful and memorized it?
		i found ibm ai ethics videos useful to my context and then i wrote about it in the memory journal, i want to make this activity fluent like a behaviour and note it down whenever i find something useful and memorize it for future use of it.
		
	the real world runs on instantaneousness, memorize when you find something useful then and there, memorize your  methods  of problem solving while building something, practic that problem solving technique to make the way fluent when next time you do it.
