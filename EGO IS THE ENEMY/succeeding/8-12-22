i succeeded in doing more than one problem in replit
i did not give up today when i could not solve the os library manipulations and gave my best and finally solved it too

i love python and i love learning and playing around with it

just because something is done, doesn't reduces its value when it is repeated

repetition is the name of the game of human, its not perfection or correction, human beings are nothing but repetitions of their surroundings over long time

whatever future holds, i would like to give my best to become one of the best artificial intelligence engineer that there is.

i shared my success today by allowing my father to use chatGPT and learn amazing things from it, my success is not from myself only but so many others surrounding me and then inside of me.

thank you god for this existence.
