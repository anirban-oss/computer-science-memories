i succeed to share my winnings with everybody who was there for me in times of distress and uncertainty and also when all was happy and good

nothing in life should be taken for granted
you need people when you are sad and you need people when happy

just help other people whenever you can and also ask for help in time of need and dont let your ego come in between what is needed and what you are doing!
