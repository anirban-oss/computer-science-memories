i am winning at doing less things each and everyday
i got to master the art of dying once again

what the fuck will happen anyway to somebody who has gone through every fucking ordeal in his life.

i love this breath that i am taking and i must continue to do so, if something good happens, if something bad then sad, whatever i feel i will just take the next best option to make my life awesome and amazing!!!

i love this life that i am living.

i succeed to share my winnings with everybody that surround me and live in a better society for future.
