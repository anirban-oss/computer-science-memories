i will share my success with everybody else even when it leaves nothing for me, because they gave a lot of it to me without even expecting anything, its okay.

i succeed to remind myself how much help i must have had to achieve this feat, and how i must do something back for them to do a fraction of justice to the unbalanced situation.

i am nobody, with everybody else, i become somebody.
i am made by others, i achieve because of others or else i am a small human in this world.
