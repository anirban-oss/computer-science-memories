i did flipkart exchange successfully

i hope it happens for amazon too

with every success i must remind how big the world is and how much i have yet to learn

i have learnt that i must do the most reliable thing when i am short of money!

i must trust my seniors because they are the only one who help me in trouble and i must do the same for them and my juniors

i know that becoming good in computer scince is the best and easiest way to make a mark of myself in this world

i must rank good in data structures and algorithms
i must rank in kaggle competitions

and the above two has to be done as soon as possible.

whenever i succeed i admit the help of everybody else who has allowed me to enjoy this love and opportunity!
