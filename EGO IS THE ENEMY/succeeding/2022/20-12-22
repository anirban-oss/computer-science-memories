i succeeded at completing my favorite two streaks of the day that  is replit and hackerrank but i want to add mle here, something on it like sql, nlp, statquest or kaggle, i worked a lot today but still feels like nothing because i did not build something, i did not problem solve in creating something, i did problem solve to manage and  find things which is not ideal right now

i did mle but not building but looking and finding out things to build, i must do the opposite tomorrow to be happy and it does  not take too much time, it can be achieved in 1 hour i assume

i did linux, i did github, i did sharing, i did snerb, i did dailyDiary, ego is the enemy, i did typing

i did  not do book, meditation, project|portfolio

i want to start with the book of atomic habits and learning how to learn or mindshift mooc again!!!

i must  become a good MLE and get a good job as soon as possible
i want to be able to make awesome projects in these  sectors
i want to be helpful to people of my society!!!!
