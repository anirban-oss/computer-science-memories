i fail to teach myself what should and shouldn't be done
i never lose my heart because failure is a part of life

its never certain who will win because the concept of win itself is vague and dependent on the culture of human lives
you can only do what you love to do and sometimes you may win and also lose

just keep going in life, this is the best that there is !
