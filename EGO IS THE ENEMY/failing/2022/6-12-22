i failed to do more python and mle and foss and hacking and dsa and sharing on youtube or some medium like that

i accept that all is not possible in a day and aim to correct myself in the future

i wish to tell people around me to do small things first and not to take too much at one time

i wish to become better in maths and want others to do the same too, i want to run a youtube channel with that aim in my mind.
