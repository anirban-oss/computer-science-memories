i failed to control my ego today
let this be a lesson

you started this computer science journey two years back in the search of a simple job in IT  and then to be able to progress gradually, now that you have a chance, do not reject it for something that doesnt exist

a bird in hand is better than two in the wind

i failed today, and this becomes my teaching for the future self and anybody else who is reading this, aspire to be equal

i will not play sad when failed, but as a teacher and continue my work and my job to help other people.
