i failed to do more of python today
but i did more of ai ethics

i want to teach myself to worry less, que sera sera

i can only control what i do, not outside events

if i know the fundamental maths is very necessary, then i will do that.
i dont care if my mentor belives in me or not. i will make her believe by my work and become one of the best ml engineer which will then allow me to do good ethics work too.

i teach myself patience today from my failure to calm own self.
