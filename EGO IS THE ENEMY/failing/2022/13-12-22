i failed at doing my streak in the morning
i failed to sleep on time yesterday

i learn and teach myself that its okay when you are excited about finishing and giving your all to a course, but also remember to be healthy when this honeymoon period is over

 i aspire to learn and teach about my failures to myself and those that want to learn from me.
