i fail to do more problem solving today
i plan to do more than daily streaks

i learn from todays failure that planning is easy and execution takes time, its not that easy just because its logical or someone has planned it

it takes time to build a good habit
it takes time to become awesome at something

it takes time to become good at your craft
craft is a slow currency

but you can build the best study table 
which you have not done yet 
and then you can blame luck
but not before that

i will teach people to go slow

i will teach people how to manage the pain of learning, basically dealing with the pangs of time that it takes to be good and awesome at something.

i will teach myself that you are good enough and to prepare yourself that it will take time and stress to become good at your desired job and actually anything in life.
