i failed to complete replit 100 days of code today

i could not solve the problems that david gave as fast as i could

i also could not play with the code that i wrote and wanted to rush through the education of it

i dont like that, i think i will go slow and learn as much as possible
if they take me its good, if they dont its better

whatever will happen, will happen 
que sera, sera

dont give up on your dreams no matter what, you got to become one of the best artificial engineers of this century

you are goinig to become the best AI engineer in the coming time 

just be humble and ego less

i will like to teach my self of tomorrow to go slow and enjoy what you have while it is with you, be kind and be helpful are the two most powerful and joyful things in the world.
