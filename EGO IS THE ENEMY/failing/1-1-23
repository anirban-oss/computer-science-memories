if i fail this year, i will not lose my heart but use that as an opportunity to pick me up again with the new knowledge i gained through it and share it with my future self and other people of the community to be of use and help.

i am a nobody, there is 99% reason for failure, i use this insight to give my best everytime i do something and hope for success.

Plan for success by prepare for failure
hope for the best, prepare for the worst
dont worry, live life as it comes to you, give your best in the moment that you are living in.
