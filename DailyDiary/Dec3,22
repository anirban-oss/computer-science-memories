I want to become the best computer scientist in the world
I want to work at Google San Francisco by the end of the year 2023

I am willing to work as hard as needed. I am willing to make all the sacrifices needed to make this dream happen for real.

I want to study about data structures and algorithms all day & night.

I want to master machine learning engineering like nobody else has done, and yes i am shaking while making this claim but if any fucker can say it and do it too, its only a fucker like you who is unafraid of anything that comes to his life

I am a daredevil, I take risks and rewards for the betterment of my society and my people

Even if i fail in mastering DSA and MLE to an awesome level, still I would become a good engineer and problem solver, i need a national rank to prove this claim of mine.

I am prepared to do all that it takes to become one of the best engineers that India has ever seen, I want to manipulate all option that is available to me and help myself and others as much as possible

I will work very hard in KaggleX mentorship program and learn and do all that i can do all day long, all night long, i want to fall in love with dsa and mle and make myself available to all the luxuries of life.

I want to be the most expensive computer science engineer in the world.
