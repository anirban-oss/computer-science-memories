I feel stressed after getting accepted to the kaggleX mentorship program.

I feel like I dont belong and others are much better than me, that I am an imposter here.
I am weak in python, linux, data science and machine learning.

THIS IS JUST NOT TRUE. WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE THIS. REMEMBER THE HARD WORK THAT YOU DID TO GET A GRANT OF INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.

You are perfect just the way you are, you are hard working, diligent, kind and helpful to yourself and others. You are a good person. You make mistakes, you fail sometimes but you are a fighter, you never give up and never allow yourself to be taken down by anything.

You will see me dying before you see me give up on my dream of becoming a Machine Learning Engineer and working in Google San Francisco.

Do not change your work routine for no reason, you still need to better your python game, you still need to better your DSA game, your FOSS game, your MLE game. You can better your game only if you keep playing no matter what, no matter the loses, no matter the failures, no matter anything, yes you do dumbest fucking mistakes and actions all the time, but dont give up then, you are the opportunity maker for yourself

whenever you make a mistake or wrong thing either compulsively or non-compulsively or impulsively, 
	say that you are sorry to yourself
	note it down
	promise and try to avoid it in future when similar events are triggered
	you can do it
	just do not give up and fail, 
	fail fast fail often learn more do more live more!
