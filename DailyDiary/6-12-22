it seems that i forgot dec5 update again, i did make ego is the enemy folder yesterday
** i did not forget, i checked, its just named 5-12-22 and not Dec5,22
** i will use one naming from now on, only numberic one

i find that folder very important to my mental health, writing my journals on that today felt liberating and powerful in my level

i want to be equal to my mentors
i want to make my juniours equal to me

ego is the enemy, i dont want my ego to stop me from asking help and asking defeat when i am defeated and success is only achievable only by accepting that fate of mine
