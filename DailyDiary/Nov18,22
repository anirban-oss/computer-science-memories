I deleted all the files in the BLIND_75 directory.
I could not understand what solution 1 meant and what was the difference between them and the other solutions on different days.

I found the meta frontend, backend, database, marketing certificates list on coursera. Yes they are awesome and even allow for financial aid.

I got my meeting fixed with Sairam Sundaresan on (9:30-10:00pm IST) on 21st or 22nd of this month of Novemeber 2022. THIS IS FUCKING CRAZY, HE IS ONE OF THE MOST AWESOME ENGINNERS AND HE WORKS FOR INTEL TOO. I AM SO LUCKY.
