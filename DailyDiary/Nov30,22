I missed yesterday, i did some work outside of this repo on github

i am a bit anxious about how to go through life if kaggle mentorship does not work and they reject me saying you are not good enough and my last option of doing good through data science is out

I believe its not upto them if i am good in data science or not, it matters if i am sticking to it for the long term or not

Nobody can tell me if am good enough to do something well or not
Only I should be able to decide if a done with a subject or not

I will give my 200% to get good at Data Science as per my mentors direction
I will prepare what i want to get out of this mentorship period of 4 months with him

as soon as i get the money, i think i will start doing coursera once again

i will make long term habits to become good in computer science
i will make a career in programming python, operating linux and creating machine learning algorithms

i want to be the best self that i can be
i want to reach my fullest potential of the time that i have left in this world

i will do everything in my power to do good in this world
i want to work at deepstash  and do well in it
