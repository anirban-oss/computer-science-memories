The December begins
Tomorrow morning is kaggleX kick-off meeting

I am going to prepare and send Vladimir of Deepstash, a product mock up of how I see deepstash can improve and accelerate its journey

I will convince him to pay me at least 2000$ once at least, for my help and time to grow his app

I will make an impact on deepstash whether he gives me money or not

I will master machine learning, I will tell him that I am not comfortable with ML and I am just learning DSA right now because I did not expect to get this grant, But I am prepared to give my 200% and become awesome in ML in the next 4 months

I will prove that with enough hard work, patience and determination, anything that I set my mind on! I can make a dent in that subject or study

I want to become one of the best computer scientist and human being on the planet, I will work hard more than anybody else, I will do everything that is good for me everyday and make myself proud of every moment because I will not give up until I am dead and buried.

I will sleep early today
I will make DSA, Hacking, MLE, FOSS, UI/UX habits that may not get me job in this month but they will make me awesome for life in one year

I will not do anything that everybody is manipulating me towards
I will become good and get a job in Google San Francisco.

I will prove my mettle to the world and live a happy life.
