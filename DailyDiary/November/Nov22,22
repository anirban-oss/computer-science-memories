Okay I forgot to update this directory yesterday as I was reorganising other folders.

Yesterday was actually very good, i finally wrote down the entire day and actually did it as per my liking of the activities in it, I am also doing the same thing today. Its wonderful!

I have a meeting with Sairam Sundaresan today, I am a bit nervous about what he is going to ask me!
I think I should read all of his tweets and youtube videos that he has made and be prepared for this meeting, I think If I can impress him enough, I will feel good about myself too.

I have lied about doing fastAI and IBL DS PC when I have only done few things that I could understand in it.

I also think that he is talking to me just to boost his knowledge of his audience and genuinely help people trying to break into the field of Machine learning.

I have completed replit 100 days code
		 deepstash blind 75 update
		 twitter/linkedin share of replit
		 doing git/github push work now
		 did monkeytype in between the above works
		 	this is it as of 1:28 PM

I opened neetcode.io but i think i feel intimidated by it as i am not understanding what he is explaining very well. I should start with just what he is saying and then memorizing that with the code that he is writing in python.

I know there are only few ways to get out of KGP and land somewhere cool, DSA and FOSS, and MLE maybe if i can learn DSA and FOSS first to fluency.
