I used github codespaces on my lovely computer-science-memories repo.

Its wonderful. I wonder when would I be good enough to get a job in Microsoft for real.

I love coding. today i learn how to install and troubleshoot wsl installation after waking up from sleep. Yesterday i did the same with git bash on windows.

I want to master DSA and nothing else. I think this would be a similar journey to that of  kettlebell expertise. It will take time and thats okay. 

I will do Replit 100 day of code today.
I will do some DSA writing and memorizing today.
