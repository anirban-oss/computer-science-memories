Sairam Sundaresan reached out to me to help me become good at AI.

I told him everything I felt, it was awesome.

I feel more convinced that I can make it in the world of AI.

I want to become a creator of codes and AI.
I want to help people build their personal philsophy using a general AI.
I want to be a github rockstar.
I want to be a python master.
I want to learn ML like nobody else can.
