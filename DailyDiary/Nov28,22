Today is November 28th of 2022.
I am thrilled to be alive on this planet
and being able to study computer science and machine learning all day long

I want to go to San Francisco and get a job at Google there.

I am pushing myself to master dsa and machine learning.

I dont think they are particulary tough with the internet being fucking filled with all sorts of answers to them.

I feel like I am not studying what really matters and is building my knowledge but idk if this is true

the only way to get a job is by getting good at dsa and ml and foss and hacking, i want the basics like george hotz and a career like that too

i have become quite good at keyboard, i want to concentrate on one thing at a time, like doing bash for the sake of bash only and similarly for ml, for python and for problem solving.

what do i need to do for these ambitions?
	if i dont have the same dreams as those that of my friends.
	i accept that i will not get a girl friend for the next 20 years
	i want to build my career for the next 20 years
	i am okay if i dont have money for the next 20 years
	i want to bulid my expertise for the next 20 years

the most happiness in my life comes from being able to reach my potential just like sunil chetri said, you are going to badly if you realize at the end of your life, how more you could have achieved if you had just given a little bit more effort to your deeds?

i want to master programming
i want to master hacking
i want to master machine learning

i realised all of this very late in my life but still i have realised all of this just in time to be effective and do something about it to still be able achieve my dream.

i want to make 100 ml projects, i want to make 100 dsa problem solutions, i want to make 100 oop projects, i want to contribute to 100 foss repositories, i want to hack the top 100 useful things and USE ALL OF THIS WORK TO HELP MYSELF AND OTHERS.

THEY CANNOT STOP YOU FOR LONG ENOUGH.
THEY CANNOT STOY YOU FROM BEING YOU.
IF YOU CAN GIVE YOUR ALL EVERYDAY, THAT'S ALL ONE CAN ASK.
IF YOU DO THE RIGHT THING EVERYDAY, ITS MORE THAN ENOUGH EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY NOT GET THE RIGHT RESULT AT RIGHT TIME OR PLACE. YOUR INTENTIONS AND ACTIONS TO GET AND DO AND BE SOMEBODY MATTERS.
