# computer-science-memories

I believe in work, not luck     
I do what I do because I love it.     

I build code,   
I memorize useful things,       
I problem solve complexities,         
I share my failings and learnings to help other people to the best of my abilities.

> _Look at a stone cutter hammering away at his rock,    
perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it.    
Yet at the hundred-and-first blow it will split in two,    
and I know it was not the last blow that did it,    
but all that had gone before._

I collect here what i have learned very well in computer science for future references.
