Computational thinking  
Design thinking  

what do you want to do?  
do you really want to make it in CS ?  
    what is the limit when you stop this journey?  
do you want to live just an easy life?  
    is it okay to you if you can never do luxury things.  

what do you want to do?  
    will computer science win that for you?
